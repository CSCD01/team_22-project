# Deliverable 3

## Feature Documentation

We have chosen 3 features to document and examine further, which are described in:

### [Issue 10773](./10773.md)
[Documentation](https://github.com/CSCD01/team_22-project/blob/10773/doc/deliverable3/10773.md)

### [Issue 7442](./7442.md)
[Documentation](https://github.com/CSCD01/team_22-project/blob/7442/doc/deliverable3/7442.md)

### [Issue 6347](./6347.md)
[Documentation](https://github.com/CSCD01/team_22-project/blob/6347/doc/deliverable3/6347.md)

And we all voted in team chat and decided to choose [Issue 6347](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/6347) for implementation, because this feature aims at helping users to save pictures in pdf files, which is the most useful and convient for users. And the fixing process is also interesting and high-level enough for our team to complete.

We also took a more granular look at the components affected both the features we have documented.
